# Hello, my name is DOS

This is the source code to a small demo (see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene) I wrote with some friends in 3-4 hours while attending Syntax 2014 (http://syntaxparty.org/) during the party. It came second in the old school competition.

 - Graphics were created by @mikehdt
 - Music was composed and tracked by Chris Mylrea (known as cTrix)
 
Development environment uses the following technologies/compilers:

 - DOSBox (http://www.dosbox.com/)
 - OpenWatcom (http://www.openwatcom.org/index.php/Main_Page)
 - PMODE/W (http://www.sid6581.net/pmodew/)
 - MikMod (http://mikmod.sourceforge.net/)

I've included MikMod in here as I couldn't get the version off SourceForge to actually compile for DOS, and had to go hunting for a version that did.

Build instructions to come soon..
